🚀 Task 1 Completed: Linear Regression Model for House Price Prediction! 🏡

Excited to share my progress on a new project with Prodigy Info Tech! I've implemented a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, the number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. 🧠📊

This model will help understand how these features impact the market value of homes, providing valuable insights for potential buyers and sellers.

Looking forward to applying more data science techniques to make even greater strides in predictive analytics!

Stay tuned for more updates!
